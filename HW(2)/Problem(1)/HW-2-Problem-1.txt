Write a Fortran program to calculate and find error% between exact derivatives and numerical derivatives of the folloeing function using all methods (forward , backward , 3-point method, 5-point method)

(i) f(x)=x*tan(x) at x=6.
(ii) f(x)=x^6-cos(x)  at x=2
(iii) f(x)=x*exp(x)-ln(x)   at x=4.0
(iv) f(x)=x*tan(x)  at x=3.0
